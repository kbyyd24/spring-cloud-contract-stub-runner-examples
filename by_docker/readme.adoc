== Setup by Docker

Spring provides a docker image to start a stub runner.

The docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner/[here], and the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.0.0.M8/single/spring-cloud-contract.html#stubrunner-docker[document] show how to use it.

You can see the example in 
include::docker-compose.yml[]
.
